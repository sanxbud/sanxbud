## Hi, I'm Sanjay! 

ðŸ‘‹ Nice to meet you! I'm a software engineer from Winnipeg - I love books, traveling, video games and hockey, and I've been glued to a screen ever since I started looking up HTML to customize my Neopets page back in elementary school.

I'm a Javascript developer primarily, but I've worked extensively with **Python**, **C++**, **React**, **SQL**, **Salesforce** and many other languages and frameworks over my years of tinkering. I love learning new stacks, and using them to build the tools and systems that solve problems and make other people's lives just a little bit easier - that's the best part about coding!
