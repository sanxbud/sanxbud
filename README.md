## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sanjay!

I'm a dev from Winnipeg with a background in computer science and history. I care about kindness, honesty, always improving, and always finding joy in whatever I'm doing

My goal is to make low-friction tools and apps that make peopleâ€™s lives easier, help create the frameworks and systems that can get people closer to their goals, and do as much as I can to help build a more empathetic and human-centred world. 

Everyone's on their own journey, and we all do a little better when we help each other out :)

#### What I work with:

- **Languages**: Python (Pandas), JavaScript/TypeScript (Node.js, React, Angular), Go, Java, Apex
- **Tools**: Linux, Git, SQL, Salesforce, REST APIs
- **Interests**: backend systems, tools that respect your focus, helpful automation, end-to-end HCI, behavioural tech, digital well-being, and tech for good

#### Currently working on:

- developing a cross-platform mobile read-later app 
- fitness challenge website based in React, Supabase, and SQLite
- building some CLI and TUI tools to get better at Go
- constantly tinkering with my i3/tmux/nvim dotfiles, lol

 Always looking to learn more about tech and physical or mental health, and always working toward becoming the best version of myself! If you've got an idea you want to collab on or share, don't hesitate to reach out! ðŸ™‚
