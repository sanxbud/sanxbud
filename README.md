## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sanjay!

I'm a dev from Winnipeg with a background in computer science and history. I care about building reliable tools that make peopleâ€™s lives easier, understanding the human behind the system, and always finding the joy in whatever I'm doing :)

#### What I work with:

- **Languages**: Python (Pandas), JavaScript/TypeScript (Node.js, React, Angular), Go (learning), Java, Apex

- **Tools**: Linux, Git, SQL, Salesforce, REST APIs

- **Interests**: backend systems, developer tools, automation, HCI, behavioural tech, digital well-being

#### Currently working on:

- Expanding my Go knowledge by building some CLI and TUI tools 

- Developing a cross-platform mobile read-later app with a focus on clean UX and quick access

- Fitness challenge website based in React, Supabase, and SQLite

- Constantly tinkering with my i3/tmux/nvim dotfiles and personal site!

I'm always learning and always looking to expand my skillset. If you've got an idea, opportunity, or want to collab, feel free to reach out! ðŸ™‚
