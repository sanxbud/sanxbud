## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sanjay!

I'm a dev from Winnipeg with a background in computer science and history. I care about building the tools that make peopleâ€™s lives easier, understanding the human behind the system, and always finding the joy in whatever I'm doing :)

#### What I work with:

- **Languages**: Python (Pandas), JavaScript/TypeScript (Node.js, React, Angular), Go (learning), Java, Apex
- **Tools**: Linux, Git, SQL, Salesforce, REST APIs
- **Interests**: backend systems, low-friction tools that respect your focus, automation, end-to-end HCI, behavioural tech, digital well-being, and tech for good

#### Currently working on:

- developing a cross-platform mobile read-later app 
- fitness challenge website based in React, Supabase, and SQLite
- building some CLI and TUI tools to get better at Go
- constantly tinkering with my i3/tmux/nvim dotfiles, lol

 Always looking to get better, learn cool new things, and just talk tech - so if you've got an idea, opportunity, or want to collab, reach out! ðŸ™‚
