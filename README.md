## Hi, I'm Sanjay! 

ðŸ‘‹ Nice to meet you! I'm a software engineer from Winnipeg - I love books, traveling, hockey, and I've been glued to a screen ever since I started looking up HTML to customize my Neopets page back in elementary.

I'm a Javascript developer primarily, but I've worked extensively with **React**, **Salesforce**, **SQL**, **Python**, **C++**, and many other languages and frameworks over my years of tinkering. I love learning new ones, and using them to build the tools and systems that solve problems and make other people's lives just a little bit better - that's the best part about coding!
